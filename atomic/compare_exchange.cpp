//compare-exchange operation is the cornerstone of programming with atomic types;
//it compares the value of the atomic variable with a supplied expected value and
//stores the supplied desired value if theyâ€™re equal.
// if the values aren't equal, the expected value is updated with the value of
// the atomic variable

// On the other hand, compare_exchange_strong() is guaranteed to return false
//only if the value wasn't equal to the expected value.
